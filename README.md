# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

Optimal Solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This repository implements multiple algorithms to find the shortest possible route visiting each city exactly once and returning to the origin. It includes visualization tools to display routes, compare algorithm efficiency, and analyze performance, making it ideal for students, researchers, and developers interested in optimization, NP-hard problems, and algorithmic problem-solving.
